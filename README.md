# PromCruise
Entry for 104-adventure-game-challenge

### Theme

The theme of the jam is A Delusion

The protagonist's main objective must be based on a belief that is clearly and obviously false (within your game's world).

The player must know from the beginning (or near the beginning) that the belief is false. ALSO, all the other characters in the story can clearly see that the belief is false. Yet the main character stubbornly keeps the belief despite all evidence and reason to the contrary.

The main character could realize the belief is false at the very end (but not before), or could not and continue believing it through the end of the game.

A classic example of this is the story of Don Quixote, although there are many other different ways the story could go.

## Story

You play Scott, a young unsecure pimply teenager who dreams of inviting his life-long crush and neighbor Gina to the school's prom. Unfortunately, Scott is a big nerd who has 0 chance of succeeding. He decides to stack all the odds in his favor by taking a shower and getting a haircut. Outside the barber shop, he is checking his phone, unknowingly standing next to Tom Cruise. A pretty girl sees Tom Cruise and goes berserk. Scott, standing in the middle, does not realize that Tom was the subject of attention. He becomes persuaded that his new look gave him the apparence of Tom Cruise and is set on asking Gina. The game follows Scott as he puts together a Mission Impossible plan to ask his neighbor for a date.
